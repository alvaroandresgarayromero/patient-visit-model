# Nurse Workflow Application
This project was created as the final project for the Udacity FullStack NanoDegree program.
It encapsulates my area of interest, which is healthcare innovation. 
In addition, this project was developed as a way to learn more about the nurse workflow,
and what technologies are out there. The reason to understand this originates from
stories that my nurse wife has told me, and how cumbersome their day-to-day workflow is when managing patient data. 

By completing this project, the student will have had the opportunity to implement all
concepts learned throughout the program, which include architecting relational database
models in Python, utilizing SQLAlchemy to conduct database queries, 
following RESTful principles of API development, structuring endpoints to respond to HTTP methods, 
including error handling, enabling role based authentication and roles-based access control 
with Autho0 (third-party authentication software as a service API), running Docker Containers, hosting the application live via Heroku,
executing unit test, creating requirements, and documentation of a web API.
